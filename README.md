AndroidPerf is a tool for profiling your Android devices.
It supports accurate and efficient measurement of Android apps' running smoothness (FPS), CPU usages and network traffic.

Our tests show that AndroidPerf provides more accurate FPS measurement on video streaming apps as compared to Solopi and PerfDog.
For example, Solopi cannot accurately measure almost all streaming apps, while PerfDog cannot handle overlay-based video playing.

The server part is [here](https://github.com/andylin-hao/AndroidPerfServer).

## Platforms

AndroidPerf runs on Windows/Linux/macOS computers to which your phones are connected.
It currently supports Android 7.0+.
Testings have been conducted on various vendors' devices, including Google, Samsung, Xiaomi, Huawei, etc.
